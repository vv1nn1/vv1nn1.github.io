I am an aspiring data scientist with background in Physics and Business Intelligence. I enjoy the process of looking for answers in data because it allows me to use my creativity and critical thinking skills to tell insightful stories. I get to push myself to see beyond and obvious and think broadly when working with data. Itâ€™s never boring!

When I am not coding or obsessing over the color and labels of ggplot, I like to travel, rearrange my furniture, and spend way too much time at grocery stores reading the random texts on packaging.
